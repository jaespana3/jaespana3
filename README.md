# 👋 Hi, I'm Jose 

I’m a certified Data Analyst with a background in Business Administration, Marketing, and Communication Design. My professional experience spans B2B sales, commercial strategy, and customer success across fast-paced tech and fintech environments in LATAM and Europe.

As I pivot into the world of data, my primary interest lies in applying analytical methods to financial and strategic decision-making. I’m especially focused on the intersection of business, technology, and insight — with the goal of delivering measurable value and long-term impact.
